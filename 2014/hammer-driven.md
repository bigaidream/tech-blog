# Hammer Driven Approach?

In a post [What You Known Matters More Than What You do](http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/06/12/what-you-know-matters-more-than-what-you-do/), the author describes a star researcher who can publish four or five important results each year. The secret appears to be that he tends to begin with techniques, not problems. He first masters a technique that seems promising, and then uses this new technique to seek out problems that were once hard but now yield easily. However, this “hammer-driven” approach seems a little bit utilitarian, and would not give rise to REAL novel research.
