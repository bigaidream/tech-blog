# Squeezing Training Data, Squeezing Publication Time

date = "2015-11-24"

Just read [Online Batch Selection for Faster Training of Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06343), and realize that it has very similar ideas as one of my project called [How to Squeeze the Training Data Efficiently and Effectively?](https://github.com/bigaidream/tech-blog/blob/master/2015/squeezing-data-time/squeezing-date-time.pdf)

Though I know that this is common in academy, I still feel a bit sad: I thought I could save it for later use... :cry:

I should also try to squeeze my publication time.
