# Reading code in GitHub made a bit easier

> date: 2016-02-17

## Painful
I've been reading Lua/Torch code recently. Maybe I'm spoiled by Python community and its nice documentations, so I feel not too comfortable about Torch code hosted in GitHub. Often times, I have to open many tabs to keep track of the definitions of functions/classes. 

[Octo-Linker](https://github.com/octo-linker/chrome-extension) is claimed to be able to navigate across files and packages on GitHub, but it does not support Python or Lua. 

## Less painful

The approach I take is ...hmm... stupid and manual: I fork those libraries I have to refer to frequently and pull them to my local systems. Then I can use Pycharm, Eclipse, Sublime or Atom to view those lovely and beautiful codes. 

So far so good.
