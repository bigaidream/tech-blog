# tech-blog
As a `lazy` programmer, I'd prefer to store all information in one place, i.e. EverNote with Markdown and then port them into blogs. I've tried lots of Blogging platforms, such as Tumblr (with support for MathJax), TinyPress, Hugo and Pelican for GitHub. Well, Hugo and Pelican are easy to read and render Markdown files, but they are a bit heavy to use (have to configure Github and local files). 

Thus I decide host my blog on GitBook. It is clean and supports math formulas, which is great.
